# Complexity Analysis

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution depends on the algorithms and data structures used. 
- The pseudocode for measuring latency and bandwidth has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of transactions in the interface monitor output.
- The reinforcement learning optimization with DQN involves training a neural network and experience replay, resulting in a time complexity ranging from O(n) to O(n^2), where n is the number of training iterations.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the solution is determined by the memory required for data structures and auxiliary variables.
- The pseudocode for latency and bandwidth measurement has a space complexity of O(1) per transaction, assuming constant memory usage.
- The reinforcement learning optimization with DQN requires memory for storing neural network parameters, experience replay buffer, and auxiliary data structures, leading to a space complexity ranging from O(n) to O(n^2), where n is the number of training iterations.
