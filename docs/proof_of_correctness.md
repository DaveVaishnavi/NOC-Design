# Proof of Correctness

The solution has been thoroughly tested and validated to ensure correctness across different scenarios. 

## Test Cases
Various test cases have been implemented to cover different aspects of the solution:
1. Basic scenarios with a few transactions
2. Large datasets with numerous transactions
3. Edge cases such as empty input or invalid formats
4. Variability in transaction types
5. Extreme transaction rates and non-uniform timestamps
6. Buffer overflow scenarios
7. Real-world workload simulations

## Expected Outputs
Each test case has corresponding expected outputs, derived from the requirements and specifications of the problem statement. These expected outputs serve as benchmarks for evaluating the correctness of the solution.
